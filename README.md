## About This Project

This repository houses a comprehensive project focused on advanced techniques in time series analysis and predictive modeling. Our work showcases a deep dive into the complexities of time-related data, emphasizing practical and theoretical aspects of various analytical techniques.

## Key Features

1. **Data Wrangling and Cleaning**: Implementing robust methods to prepare raw time series data for analysis, ensuring data quality and reliability.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting thorough initial assessments of the data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses.
3. **Visualization**: Utilizing a range of visualization tools to represent time series data effectively, making the data storytelling aspect both insightful and accessible.
4. **Time Series Analysis Techniques**: 
    - **Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Applying these techniques for smoothing time series data to identify trends.
    - **Differentiation and Decomposition**: Breaking down time series into trend, seasonality, and error components.
    - **Analysis of Seasonality and Trends**: Investigating cyclic patterns and long-term direction in time series data.
    - **Stationarity Analysis**: Assessing and ensuring the stationarity of time series, a crucial assumption for many analytical models.
5. **Predictive Modeling**:
    - **ARIMA/SARIMAX Models**: Building and tuning Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) models for forecasting.
    - **Grid Search for Feature Engineering**: Employing grid search techniques to optimize features and improve model performance.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to provide a detailed and practical guide to time series analysis and predictive modeling. It serves as a resource for students, data analysts, and researchers interested in deepening their understanding of time series data.
