# Global_Warming_Project
EDA, Data Modeling, Predictive models

Key Features:

Data Wrangling and Cleaning: Implementing robust methods to prepare raw time series data for analysis, ensuring data quality and reliability.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting thorough initial assessments of the data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses.
Visualization: Utilizing a range of visualization tools to represent time series data effectively, making the data storytelling aspect both insightful and accessible.
Time Series Analysis Techniques:
Moving Average (MA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Applying these techniques for smoothing time series data to identify trends.
Differentiation and Decomposition: Breaking down time series into trend, seasonality, and error components.
Analysis of Seasonality and Trends: Investigating cyclic patterns and long-term direction in time series data.
Stationarity Analysis: Assessing and ensuring the stationarity of time series, a crucial assumption for many analytical models.
Predictive Modeling:
ARIMA/SARIMAX Models: Building and tuning Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) models for forecasting.
Grid Search for Feature Engineering: Employing grid search techniques to optimize features and improve model performance.
